# Asitepaper
A repository for the paper about the A-site dependence on the free energy of MHPs

## Repository Structure

- **MLPtraining**: Contains input files for machine learning potential (MLP) training and ab initio dataset generation
- **TIworkflow**: Includes simulation files for thermodynamic integration calculations of Gibbs free energy across phases, plus post-analysis scripts for paper figures

For detailed instructions, refer to the README file in each folder.
